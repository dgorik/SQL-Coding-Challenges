# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT s.product_id, p.first_year, s.quantity, s.price
-- we process the main subquery after the subquery below, we extract the columns above from the Sales tables and assign an allias of s to that table
FROM Sales s
-- we then join the main query with the subquery by keeping all the columns in the main query and bringing first_year column from the subquery
LEFT JOIN(
    SELECT product_id, MIN(year) as first_year
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY product_id
)p
-- this subquery select the product id and also the minimum year that each product was sold. We then set an alias for this subquery so we can reference its results 
ON s.product_id = p.product_id AND s.year = p.first_year 
-- The product_id in the Sales table must match the product_id in the subquery result.
-- The year in the Sales table must match the first_year from the subquery result.
WHERE p.first_year IS NOT NULL
